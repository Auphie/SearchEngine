I think this is as important to know about as the flu in a newborn baby! Check with your vet to see if parvo is a problem in your area. It is a problem here and the vets do not always readily offer the advice or information SO ASK! Better safe then sorry, and your pet will love you for being informed!!! \\nParvovirus attacks a dogs digestive system. Common symptoms include vomiting and diarrhea, which worsens as the disease begins to take over and can lead to blood cell count changes and bloody diarrhea. The major problem...dehydration. Vet care is necessary, whether left in their care or out patient care (you take care of them) but the vet will likely recommend the puppy stay there. They need fluids and many different medications to help cure this disease. If and only if you cannot afford treatment at the hospital make sure you follow instructions and bring the dog in frequently to the vet to be checked over.  \\n*Always make sure a snap test is performed as vomiting and diarrhea can also be causes of other illnesses.* \\nParvo can occur in any dog that is not vaccinated, normally attacking the young puppies!!!!! Puppies need a series of vaccines (DA2PP in most states) to protect them from this horrible disease. The other part of protection, is US the OWNER! Dogs not fully vaccinated should not be in areas which other dogs can touch. This includes but is not limited to common areas in apartments/housing communities, dog parks!, pet stores, and other peoples homes with unvaccinated dogs or frequently visiting dogs. Once your dog has been fully vaccinated it is up to you if you want to continue with yearly vaccines or have titers done to be sure your pets shots are still actively protecting them. \\nParvo can live in an area for many years and is passed on through contaminated fecals. You can even track parvo on your shoes into your home so extra precausions are necessary until your new puppy is fully vaccinated (not the 1st but the 3rd or 4th depending on your vet). Also make sure visitors are washing their hands if they have a tendancy to touch strange dogs or visit parks or pets stores. People do it with their newborns (request you wash your hands) so why not do it with your puppy? \\nPlease pass on this info as even if you do not have the disease in your area it can be brought in by a pet from an outside area. Again please check with your vet to see if your area has known Parvo cases and make sure your pet has its shots before introducing them to others!!

It is commonly known as Parvo. The virus can \"adapt\" over time, and other strains of the virus have appeared since then, but properly administered vaccinations are the best protection. \\r\\nWhat are the signs seen with Parvovirus infection?\\r\\nThere are three main manifestations of Parvovirus infection: \\r\\n1.      Asymptomatic - No signs seen. Common in dogs over 1 year old and vaccinated dogs.\\r\\n2.      Cardiac - This form of the disease is much less common than the intestinal form due to widespread vaccination. Severe inflammation and necrosis (cell death), of the heart muscle causes breathing difficulty and death in very young (less than 8 weeks of age) puppies. Older dogs that survive this form have scarring in the heart muscle.\\r\\n3.      Intestinal - This virus causes extreme damage to the intestinal tract, causing sloughing of the cells that line the tract. This can leave the patient open to secondary bacterial infection. Most of the affected dogs (85%) are less than one year old and between 6-20 weeks old -- before the full set of vaccinations can be given. The death rate from infection is reported to be 16-35% in this age group.*\\r\\nThe intestinal signs include: \\r\\n·         Lethargy\\r\\n·         Vomiting\\r\\n·         Loss of appetite\\r\\n·         Diarrhea - usually bloody, and very foul-smelling (a characteristic odor, particular to Parvovirus infection)\\r\\n·         Intussusception - when a section of the inflamed intestinal tract telescopes into itself. This is an emergency.\\r\\n·         Fever\\r\\nThe onset of clinical signs is usually sudden, often 12 hours or less. The incubation from exposure to seeing the clinical signs varies from 3 to 10 days. \\r\\nHow is Parvovirus infection diagnosed?\\r\\nThis disease is diagnosed by physical examination, signalment (age, vaccination status, breed, etc.), and a fecal Parvo (ELISA) test. Additional diagnostics include blood work and radiographs. Dogs infected with Parvo typically have a low white count. Radiographs help rule out other potential causes for vomiting and diarrhea.

Unfortunately, before we got him we had two puppies that were outside of our dog pen that were abandoned by their mom and apparently they had parvo and died not long after even after I tried to help when I realized they had it.. But even after cleaning up everything, including spraying bleach/water solution around the house and yard (it helps kill the virus but only in time (1 year I believe), when I got Boss he contracted the disease after 2 weeks. I was aware that he could possibly get the disease but he had nowhere else to go so we kept him and I made sure to go ahead and get Durvet Canine Spectra 5 vaccine and keep it refrigerated (which I was going to use on him the following weekend but he started showing parvo signs early in the week).  \\r\\nHe woke me up with vomiting noises and bloody diarrhea on his puppy pad at around 3AM, I immediately knew that the disease was taking hold of him so I grabbed the vaccine from my fridge and frantically mixed the solution together quickly because he was not looking good and wouldn\\'t eat or drink anything so I grabbed the back of his neck skin (firstly had to make sure I wasn\\'t in a vein by pulling back on the syringe and for my first time at giving shots, I was a natural because I got the correct spot.) and so I gave him the vaccine. After that I stayed up with him all night and I poured some Gatorade in his mouth because at first he would not take it on his own but after that he did drink it a bit by himself. The next morning after Boss and I finally got a bit of rest, we both got up at around 8-9AM and he was getting better, he was a bit playful and hyper again, he wanted to play somewhat, and he started eating and drinking good again.. (Gatorade gives some electrolytes which surprisingly works a good bit of the time to rid the body of the disease, if you catch the disease early on and can\\'t do anything else because when I was younger, I had an older pup that got the disease and we poured Gatorade in his mouth every 30 minutes and he got well pretty quickly and we made sure to stay up with him so he wouldn\\'t dehydrate.) \\r\\nSo let\\'s just say this..

I think most assume it was a variant of the feline virus (the one that causes panleukopenia, aka cat distemper) as cats are the closest pet that millions of dogs had been exposed to that had a parvo virus of its own.  Normally parvo viruses are 'species' specific (actually even genus specific is not accurate... many genera of cats are susceptible to the same cat parvo virus)- meaning only that group of animals (cats lets say) are susceptible to each parvo virus.  Dogs had, up until the late 1970s, no problem being around cats with parvo as they were not closely enough related to contact the disease.  Something happened in the late 70s and suddenly dogs had their own parvo virus.  And no one had a vaccine for it yet so most vets were using either the cat vaccine or the mink vaccine, with at least some success, but not great.  Once a vaccine was finally created specifically for dogs, the disease at least was controlled somewhat.  But still no knows for sure where it came from exactly. \\r\\n2.  The second to last story is a good example of infection and disease- not all exposed pets will die or even come down with the virus if infected, though it seems most will as it is a pretty aggressive virus.  All unvaccinated, and partially vaccinated dogs are susceptible to canine parvo virus, even if several years old (though it seems partially vaccinated mature dogs, having a mature immune system, are more resistant).   \\r\\n3.  the last story shows how easily this virus is to spread, and how hard it is to effectively sterilize an environment (particularly an outdoor one, such as dirt, gravel or foliage).  Washing with bleach does very little to neutralize the virus- a prolonged contact time with a virucidal product, such as bleach (even diluted bleach will work fine) is required to effectively kill this virus (15 minutes is the minimum time recommended- a challenge when trying to kill this virus in dirt).   \\r\\nIt also demonstrates one of the common outcomes of an infection in many dogs- a short illness and a quick recovery.  Some puppies do well while others may do poorly.   \\r\\nAnd it also reminds us that fluids are extremely important (probably the most important part of the parvo treatment as dehydration is the number one killer of parvo puppies).   \\r\\nAnd lastly it shows the problem with 'cause and effect' in medicine, as this writer assumed the vaccine had something to do with the puppy's recovery when it did not.  The disease itself is a far better stimulant of an immune response than any vaccine is, nor can a vaccine have any effect on a disease that is actively making a dog ill- if anything, it would be more likely to stress the immune system further and make recovery more difficult.  We do NOT recommend vaccinating animals in the middle of a disease for several reasons.  But despite all that, the puppy got better (likely the gatoraid had some positive effect).   It is even controversial whether or not to continue a puppy's parvo vaccine schedule once they recover from the disease, though most veterinarian's do continue the series of vaccines mostly due to the combo vaccine's prevention of the other viruses (mainly distemper). \", 'quotation': []}, {'url': 'http://www.dogforum.com/dog-health/what-parvo-5256/page9/', 'page': 'page 9', 'title': '\"What is Parvo?\"', 'floor': '84', 'author_url': 'http://www.dogforum.com/members/170170/', 'author_name': 'redbot', 'post_date': {'date': '10-18-2016', 'time': '01:12', 'ampm': 'PM'}, 'author_info': {'member_type': 'Junior Member', 'posts': '1', 'mentioned': '0 Post(s)', 'tagged': '0 thread(s)'}, 'content': ' Nice post. thanks for sharing!

Going online is probably the last thing any worried dog mum should do but I\\'m super surprised about two things. \\r\\nFirstly, the high mortality rate. The first vet we went to today basically disappeared after we had Sammy diagnosed with Parvo. No one wanted to enter the room so I was left sitting by myself until my husband came to pick me up to take Sammy and me to the ER. The ER recommended he be admitted and monitored and put on fluids etc but said that \"most dogs make it\" and \"it\\'s not like you\\'re paying for treatment for a dog that\\'s unlikely to survive\". Either way, we\\'d throw all the money in the world at the vet if there was a slim change of survival. \\r\\nThe second thing was that there are an awful lot of posts, blogs and advice out there that says not to have your dog admitted but to take care of him at home by constantly giving the dog pedialyte, rubbing honey on his gums, spoon-feeding him broth, etc. The consensus here is that your dog needs to know you love him and that he won\\'t survive unless he has you near him, otherwise he might be too depressed to fight the disease. \\r\\nObviously I was distraught at reading this but it seems like there\\'s a different feeling throughout this thread. \\r\\nAnyway, Sammy is 4 months old, we got him from a shelter and have only had him for two weeks. He had all his vaccines but some of these were back in Qatar which is where the shelter flew him in from, so we can\\'t really verify anything. He started showing symptoms yesterday and I took him in today. No bloody stool but diarrhea, vomiting, lethargy and  dehydration.  \\r\\nNo sleep for me tonight... ', 'quotation': []}]\n"

My dog Sam recently just went through a health scare. Our vet does accept Care Credit but we do not qualify for it due to our bad credit (I guess we aren't almost anyone). We know this since we have had pets that needed expensive surgery but when we applied we were always denied. Our vet does not like to accept payments so we were forced to make that awful decision that no one wants to make. I love my pets dearly and always do my best to get them the care they need. \\r\\nAnyway, when Sam was acting not like herself, I became concerned. She was in heat and one morning, she began bleeding heavily (gushing) and we brought her to the vet. She had pyometra. We were never told that this could happen and we were never really encouraged to get her spayed. She goes to the vet for regular check ups and even at her last check up, they suspected pyometra but never mentioned it to us. (We found this out when she had to have emergency surgery.) She ended up having surgery that day. It has now been a month since then and she is doing fine. \\r\\nLucky for us, we persuaded the vet to work with us and let us make payments. The bill was not that expensive (which is why I believe they allowed the payments) but due to circumstances beyond our control, we still cannot afford the payments. I have set up a fundraising campaign on GoFundMe to raise the money.

New members posting in the health section please read \\nfirst aid is not meant to replace vet care.  \\nlearning pet first aid and cpr may just help you save the life or your pet. i took a dog cpr/first aid class a couple of weeks ago and i wanted to share some of what i learned with everyone here. the red cross has a website too so if you want more info or want to check for a class in your area check out www.redcross.com i found the class to be very worthwhile and i learned a lot. \\nfirst this link gives a really good list of all the things that you should keep int a kit Making a First Aid Kit for Your Dog \\nthere are only a couple of things i would add to this list and they are:\\n-a supply of any special medications you already know that your pet will need\\n-you may want an e-collar that you know fits your pet(the cone head thing, not a shock collar)\\n-a list of all your dogs current vaccinations...and proof(you will often need these if there is an emergency and you need to have your dog boarded somewhere-most emergency shelters do not allow pets)\\n-i also recommend buying a muzzle rather than the kind you make (just my preference from experience, my dog was still able to nip me with the homemade on on)\\n-the site lists benedryl, some dogs don't do very well on benedryl...check with your vet before adding it too your kit \\nthe other really important thing i learned was to figure out what is normal for my dog before i was faced with an emergency. you should learn how to take your dog's temperature, check for a pulse and what is normal for both. you should also learn how to check your dogs mouth and lips (or eye lids if these are too dark...) for signs of shock...and again, what is normal for your dog. i would guess that your veterinarian could help you with this stuff during your dog's next exam.\\nit is also really important that you crate train your dog. there was a recent natural disaster type situation in my area and a lot of people had to be evacuated. in that type of high stress emergency situation...what will you do with your dog? a lot of dogs suffered more injuries and more stress because they hadn't been crate trained.\\nso... there it is (in a tiny nutshell) hope this helps! \", 'quotation': []}, {'url': 'http://www.dogforum.com/dog-health/first-aid-kit-1518/', 'page': 'page 1', 'title': 'First Aid Kit', 'floor': '6', 'author_url': 'http://www.dogforum.com/members/108/', 'author_name': 'Criosphynx', 'post_date': {'date': '10-01-2009', 'time': '12:50', 'ampm': 'AM'}, 'author_info': {'member_type': 'Senior Member', 'location': \"Som'where between Utopia and Insomnia.\", 'join_date': 'Dec 2008', 'posts': '11,482', 'mentioned': '9 Post(s)', 'tagged': '1 thread(s)'}, 'content': ' Good info!  \\nIam guilty of not owning a muzzle...perhaps I should change that!
