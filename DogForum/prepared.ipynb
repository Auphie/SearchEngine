If you don't mind, I'd like to share Lola's story with her weight struggle.  When Lola was spayed at 7 months old she weighed 21 lbs. Lola is one of the larger Pug's. She will never be 12-18lbs like most of them, her body just has a larger build. The next summer we took her in for another check-up and she weighed in at 28lbs. She was teetering on the edge of being overweight, and being normal size. So, at that point we didn't change her food or do anything differently. They just told us to watch her treats, and make sure not to give her table food (we didn't give her any before then either). Moving forward to last summer she weighed 31lbs. Keep in mind, she's only eating 1 1/4 cups of food a day and getting only the occasional low fat treat with daily (short) walks. They also recommended we put her on a diet dog food. We did that as well. This past September we took her in for having difficulty breathing. She had gained 3 more pounds!   This is Lola at her heaviest, weighing 34 lbs.    At that point her Vet decided that we had to do something drastic. You can't walk a dog that can't breathe, so exercise was out of the question. Her thyroid had been checked three times at this point, and full blood panels. Her Vet decided she needed to go on a medication called Slentrol. Basically, it's a dog diet medication. I was not thrilled about it at all, who wants their dog to take something like that? I didn't. But, I felt like if we didn't do something at that point, she was going to die. So, I agreed to try the Slentrol. I was extremely worried about side effects. The only side effects are vomiting, she has vomited one time in almost 3 months of being on the medication. To this date Lola has lost 4 lbs. It's unreal the difference in her energy level, and over all well being. I'm not saying Slentrol is for every overweight dog, it isn't. Most dogs with diet restrictions and exercise can loose the weight. Lola simply could not. I just wanted to share our story, and never go in and ask you Vet for Slentrol. They recommended it to me. You need to exhaust all other options before resorting to medication. I have no idea what will happen when she goes off Slentrol. I will update this thread when she takes her last dose.\"}\n",

What do you do now?!  ACT FAST.  As soon as you find your dog gone: If your dog is microchipped, call the company and report your dog lost.  Depending on your service contract with them, they may contact local vets and shelters for you. Ask them who they contact so you don\\'t lose valuable time contacting the same places.  Hit the streets!  Spend an hour or so looking for your dog close to the area he escaped (ie a 2 mile radius).  Contact your family/friends/neighbors to see if they will help look for your dog or split up the tasks below with them.  Make sure everyone looking has some super enticing treats like meat (go pick up fast food burgers if you need to) and a leash.  Be efficient and get as many people to help as possible within the shortest amount of time.   ***Think about your dog and why he may have escaped: is he/she intact and possibly out to mate?--start with neighbors with intact animals.  Is your dog a hunting dog?--look in your nearby parks.  Does your dog have a best friend nearby?--head over there.  Does your dog have a favorite hangout nearby?--check for him there. Knock on doors, drive around, check neighboring yards, check out parks/fields.***  If there is no sign of him after an hour/two and you have no one assisting you,  take a break from the search to make sure all of your local vets, shelters/rescues, animal control (or police/sheriff if you don\\'t know your AC) are contacted with your information.  If you can email them a oood photo, do it.  Give them the time, day, location from which the dog went missing, a physical description, dog\\'s name, and any important health/behavior they need to know if they find the dog.  (After the first 24 hours, extend your search to regional/statewide shelters/vets/AC and also contact your local groomers, trainers, petsitters, etc.)  (If you have any helpers, make sure some keep searching while others get the word out.)  Use technology -Throw up an ad on Craigslist in the Pets and Lost/Found section--offer a reward but don\\'t list the amount.  -ut up a lost post on your Facebook and your other social networks and ask your friends to share it.  -Send out a group text with the info above and ask them to forward it--with both the lost dog info and a request for volunteers to help you continue looking for your dog.  --Locate lost/found FB groups in your region (Google) and try posting to Missing Pets US.  -Also try posting to your local/regional dog training clubs and dog trainers and groomers\\' FB pages.  Google \"lost my dog\" should bring up services for your area if your internet has permission to \"know\" your location.  -Some websites that provide lost dog services include: petamberalert.com, lostmydoggie.com, missingpet.net, fidofinder.com . After you spend an hour or so getting the word out, go back to canvasing your neighborhood/city.  If you have lost flyers ready to go, take them and post them wherever you can legally in a five mile radius.  If it\\'s nearing the end of the day, head out to dog parks, pet stores, farm/feed stores, popular coffee shops and bars, etc to post your flyer.   If after the first day, you still haven\\'t found, go old school!  That night, submit online to your local classifieds papers and newspapers a lost dog ad; if they don\\'t have an online form, call them asap in the morning.  Many times, this is a free service for a basic ad, but I\\'d recommend you pay a little for the photo ad.  Then, go check the likely areas again and stop by your shelters to see if he has turned up there.  It can be difficult for high-volume shelters to identity dogs from lost reports to incoming dogs.  What to do if your dog is gone overnight: open your yard gates and/or a familiar door to the house if possible.  If that is not possible/applicable, leave a familiar crate and/or bed outside of your residence with some water and a piece of your clothing.  (If your dog went missing from someplace that is not your home, leave that crate/water/clothing at the last place you were together with your dog.)  Take the weather into account and check for him frequently.  Don\\'t leave food out if there any any chance of wildlife or stray/outside animals that may eat it/hang out/deter your dog from getting closer.  What to do if you/someone spots your dog and he doesn\\'t come right to you:Use a happy, friendly, excited voice.  Resist any urges to use a stern tone to \\'make him mind.\\'  Clap, make kissy sounds, whistle--whatever you can do to be exciting.Don\\'t face the dog or try to approach him directly.  Don\\'t try chasing or cornering him, especially if you are in an area with traffic.  Squat down, angled away, show the yummy food you brought, and let the dog approach.  Roll little bits towards him, while trying to call him over.If you are struggling trying to get his attention, try running the opposite direction or \"find\" something super interesting over on the ground and make a huge deal over it. Remember that dogs can and will travel a long ways when they get lose.  Even dogs that are friendly and well trained may get very frightened, stressed, and overwhelmed when they get loose and may be difficult to catch. They may also be picked up by people \"traveling through\" and end up hundreds or thousands of miles away.  Someone may take the dog in, think they want to keep him,  eventually decide they aren\\'t the right home for him, and then, even months later, put up \"rehome\" or \"found\" ads for him.  Don\\'t give up.  Keep checking shelters and rescues for your dog--go visit them IN PERSON, don\\'t just check on their websites or sites like petfinder--many shelters don\\'t keep those updated or put found dogs on them during their holding period.  Things you can do to improve your chances of having your dog returned:-MICROCHIP your pet AND keep the contact information UP TO DATE with Photo.-Keep a collar and ID tag on your dog.  -Have good quality photos available for flyers/ads-Even better, make the template for your flyer Today, so that all you have to do is fill in the date/location of when/where he went missing.-Maintain his city/county dog license and/or rabies vaccinations--both tags/databases provide yet another way to reconnect you to your dog.

This clears out everything and sometimes causes mild diarrhea but can clear out mild obstructions without surgery.  I don't remember if they tried that with my cat or not.  Iv fluids helped it pass but I did surgery anyway. By the time they opened him up it was almost passed so they closed him back up and let it pass naturally rather than messing with his intestines and colon.  But he was vomiting nonstop for a day, like six times just bile. Then he hid and wouldn't eat or drink all night so was acting much sicker.

I would keep looking for a solution if your dog is not in pain (so I have the same advice others have) or not suffering.   I cannot do my dog's nails either.  I'm one of few people who she allows to touch her paws and nails but when she knows her nails are getting trimmed, she pulls away and I'm not good at dealing with that.   Even groomers and vets can't easily touch her, they need assistants or to restrain her in some way - muzzle etc.   I have tried to help and we have done the treat distraction method but she will still try to get at the person trying to trim the nails.

I agree with @revolutionrocknroll - if they can\\'t cover the cost of a mismate injection & a simple office visit, there\\'s no way they can afford to rear a litter properly, even assuming she whelps per the textbook, & with no complications whatever.

He doesn\\'t have to spend 8-hrs a day licking it, to introduce bacteria - or just moisture, in which microbe-popns explode.The odd lick, once or twice in a 12-hr period, is quite sufficient to cause problems.

He also cannot be outside a confined area, preferably a crate, whenever U aren\\'t home to monitor him - even if he\\'s indoors, inside the house. JUMPING is a no-no while his sutures are holding the incision - so he can\\'t be free in the house when at home solo, as he could easily jump onto a sofa, onto or OFF a bed, or sprint down the stairs, & split his incision or pop multiple stitches. He must WALK up & down all stairs, 1 step at a time - no hopping 2 & 3 steps in a bound, nor launching from the landing to thud onto the floor below! If U have any concerns - swelling, puffiness around stitches, DRAINAGE with color, a feeling of HEAT from the incision / much warmer than surrounding tissue, etc, go see a vet.If he flinches or yelps when it\\'s touched, SEE THE VET - it should be only slightly tender to pressure, not painful to touch.

I have been somewhat curious about the tendency of dogs to lick wounds because  most all seem to and wondered if it was a significant drawback in the process of the wound healing. There are numerous wives\\' tales about a dog\\'s saliva and potential benefits which date back many centuries. I certainly cannot attest to the veracity of the supposed benefits but research has defined certain benefits and reasoning as to why a dog among other animals might lick their wounds. A few are quoted below. \"  Recent research has identified products in saliva that indeed aid in healing.   Researchers in the Netherlands identified a chemical in pet saliva  called histatins. Histatins speed wound healing by promoting the spread  and migration of new skin cells. Dr. Nigel Benjamin of the London School of medicine has shown that  when saliva contacts skin it creates nitric oxide. Nitric oxide inhibits  bacterial growth and protects wounds from infection. Researchers at the University of Florida isolated a protein in  saliva called Nerve Growth Factor that halves the time for wound  healing.\"  I am of the belief that dogs may exhibit this behavior because there actually could be a method to their \"madness\".

When I did research wondering the same thing I was advised to do the surgery since only very small dogs were usually able to be managed without surgery.  He was very hyper and active and a terrible patient.  He literally tore his wound apart, quickly chewed up all bandages, learned that he could smash and break cones easily by ramming into edges of walls and furniture hard, gave himself an infection from chewing the wound and this was all on heavy doses of sedation and pain meds to calm him down.  He hated vets so had to be sedated and muzzled for any visit.He loved the hydrotherapy though. You risk the other leg going too from the strain of compensating with a dog that size.  Which happened to him two years later.  The other CCL tore two years later so had to go through the whole thing again on the other hand knee.  Fun!  The surgery on the first leg was supposed to minimize the strain on his other hind leg but since he was such a bad patient he had a long tough recovery.  Also despite him supposed to be staying quiet and on pretty high doses of sedation and pain meds that were supposed to knock him out, they barely touched him at the highest safest doses they could prescribe and he was bounding around on three legs flying up and down my three flights if stairs for his bathroom trips and flying around the apartment.Good luck keeping a large fit hyper active dog quiet for months.But I did the surgery both times and was strongly advised to.  Hopefully it'll go better with your dog!  The surgery and healing was fine I just had a difficult patient!\"}\n",

It sounds like recovery was a bit of a rollercoaster with your dog.  My dog is terrible at the vets too once she's in the patient room- muzzled and always needs to be heavily sedated. Wonderful when no one is prodding her though!She's only a couple days into 'bedrest' and looks like she's gonna go crazy, so I am going to try and stock up on some chews to keep her mentally stimulated in her crate until we can resume leash walks. It sounds like this will be a long ride... I am concerned about the likelihood of a 2nd rupture happening if I chose to have this surgically repaired too. Partly the difficulty of the recovery period (x2) impacting quality of life, and also sucking up the cost of two very pricey surgeries one a single income. It seems the surgery option is so much easier for natural laid back dogs!\"}\n",

There's always a risk of the other hind leg getting arthritis and an injury from overcompensating in large dogs but it's less common with surgery.  My dog went a full two years and a bit longer  before his second surgery and injury.  He was seven and unluckily got stepped on by my horse which caused the initial injury.  But immediately after the surgery he was fully weight bearing and not limping anymore.  It would have been months to get him bearing weight without the surgery and his other leg would have gone much sooner.  He was close to ten before he needed the second surgery. He was also an extremely energetic hyper fit high energy dog who absolutely required at least two hours of running every day.  We had to play fetch til he literally dropped and he had to go with me to the stable with me daily and help me with the horses.  He could keep up with my fast moving horses for hours on the trails and jump huge horse fences until ten or more years old.  So he would have been a terrible patient regardless. For a large dog it's quicker and safer to do the surgery and I was told makes it less likely of a second injury down the line.  My dog was extreme with the wear and tear he out on his legs and joints he ran and jumped high fences daily.\"}\n",

So sorry to hear about your dog, rotten. That's got to be so tough to see your dog not coping at all. My pup has, thankfully, been handling the extreme rest restrictions much better than I ever thought (so far), considering she is a very high energy farm dog- probably similar to Shadowmom's previous dog. Loves chasing the horses, hacking out, and going for bike rides. Gets several walks on top of that each day. I've been really, really focusing on keeping her mentally stimulated- teaching her new 'tricks' that aren't going to hurt her legs (i.e. identifying objects, moving head certain ways on command, etc.), giving her dog treat puzzles and also having a variety of durable chews for her. Cutting her food ration down by atleast 1/3 has been necessary with the lack of exercise. Vet has offered sedatives for me to give while she's on the prolonged bedrest, but I'd rather not have her drugged for 4months..... I'm worried because she's now already been on 4+ weeks of bed rest, still has a few weeks before vet even has time for the surgery, and then another 12-16 weeks of rest/extreme limited activity from there.....  I hope she will stay happy enough during this time....I don't want her to be miserable.  It's so hard deciding what's right. I've done lots of research and hear so many horror stories about recovery, but there are lots of (apparent) successes too....

He didn't walk on a leash, he bounced and flew!Complicating matters further were during his first injury and surgery I also injured my knee and needed and eventually had surgery on it so had a lot of difficulty managing and helping him.  I think I had also started graduate school then too.  During his second surgery years later I was working fifty or more hours a week and had a medical issue and another surgery and wasn't supposed to lift more than twenty pounds.  All the while living in a third floor apartment with no elevator and narrow twisty stairs that were easy to fall on while not injured and half carrying a seventy five pound hyper squirming pulling strong dog!  So he absolutely needed the sedatives!  He would bound out the top door and jump off all the stairs and just fly down at the speed of light, even three legged.  When not injured I usually let him go down loose to avoid getting pulled down.I don't miss that apartment and when I got this current dog I immediately taught him to wait on the stairs and walk nicely down with me.If your dog has been good this long without any sedation she might be fine for the duration.  You always have the option if tranquilizers later.\"}\n"

I have always had a very, very difficult time deciding upon euthanasia. I consider 'happy of the mind' of higher importance than 'discomfort in the body'. Some people try and weigh based on good days vs. bad days.  Based on my experience with older animals, I know that things like arthritis aren't generally going to get better. In this case, I would look to the dog's state of mind. Does he seem happy, overall, still? It sounds like he does...but you will know best.  Dogs will hide pain. But if he's not crying or in obvious constant or frequent distress then I, personally, wouldn't see an immediate *need* for euthanasia, or feel it is a quality of life issue. But at the end of the day, there is nothing wrong with choosing to set him free either if there is an inkling of doubt in your mind. The others are right in that it is a difficult decision with no right or straightforward answer. Just as long as you are keeping the dog's interests above your own.

I would imagine the circling could be due to the head trauma, but if the doctor said nerves in her ear were affected, that could maybe cause vestibular issues, which could cause circling. Definitely let him know, and maybe even try to show him what exactly she is doing, either by taking her to see him, or videoing it. Regarding the ear drooping, I had a dog who had facial nerve paralysis, and her lip on that side of her face drooped, as did her lower eyelid (slightly less so, and eventually both more or less resolved). Again, your vet might better be able to guess whether it's that, or something unrelated. The circling sounds like the more serious of the two, as that could indicate something related to the central nervous system. It might be worthwhile to see a veterinary neurologist, even if you can't afford the imaging right now, as they have much more experience with neuro issues than your vet will, and may have seen a similar case before.\"}\n"

My boy kept having chronic diarrhea and one of the causes of it was stress induced colitis.  Colitis has a pretty distinctive smell, basically the diarrhea smells horrid, along with some other tell tale signs, so I don't doubt that it was one of the causes.  Once the treatment for it was finished he kept having diarrhea, despite my feeding him chicken and rice, or the canned prescription diet.  I finally switched to lean beef and sweet potato (something he'd never had) and he stopped having diarrhea.  I switched him to chicken free, grain free, kibble, and got rid of any treats that had chicken in them, and he didn't have diarrhea, I tried giving him some chicken and he had soft stool.

It\\'s safest to keep them crated whenever U are not literally in the same room, or for active dogs who jump about indoors, just leash her to Ur waist on a short 4-ft lead, so she doesn\\'t have sufficient length to hop onto anything.She needs to WALK up or down stairs, literally one step at a time, so don\\'t let her fake U out - 2 or 3 days of being reasonable off-leash don\\'t mean a thing; the very next day, she might decide to race down the steps & jump on someone entering the door, & pop 4 or 5 stitches... so i wouldn\\'t take the chance. Indoors, i\\'d umbilical her to me anytime she wasn\\'t literally crated, & outdoors, i\\'d give her no more than 5-ft of leash max, while watching like a hawk for any sign that she was about to get frisky. \"No off leash exercise, no running, no jumping\" is 10 days long - she can walk just as far as U want to take her, she just can\\'t RUN & very especially, she must not jump. // U can set aside a couple of hours for a good long walk to get the ants out of her pants, every 2 to 3 days.  As she\\'s umblicaled, U can also use the 10-days for training time indoors - work on manners at bottlenecks [a default so that she pauses to let U go 1st], being patient & working on a chewy such as an antler while U are on-line or watching telly, etc.U can train for polite behavior at the table - \"lie down behind me on a mat, & i\\'ll give U something nice for being good, every 5 to 10 or 2 minutes\". [Don\\'t forget to provide her with busywork - a cow hoof or something long-lasting.] training won\\'t tire her physically, but it tires her mentally, while keeping her busy & improving her focus. Walking briskly point-to-point, & pausing at likely spots to let her sniff, will also help gratify her need to move & keep her nose happy. For the 1st 24 to possibly 48-hrs, U may see a thin clear pale-yellow fluid seep from her stitches; that\\'s within normal, it\\'s SERUM - the liquid part of blood. It\\'s see-thru.What U do not want to see is any other color! - no pink, no red, no GREEN, no creamy opaque pus, nuthin\\'.After 48-hrs, there should be zero drainage of any kind; the incision should be pink, dry, & not puffy or swollen. It should feel [i\\'d touch it with a gloved hand, wearing a fresh disposable glove] slightly warmer than the surrounding skin, but never \"hot\".Between 3 & 5 days out, the incision should be pale pink, dry, & almost the same temp as the skin around it. She may be tender for 2 to possibly 5 days, but that\\'s a passing phase, & when it\\'s over, she\\'ll feel FINE & want to be an idiot - don\\'t let her. There are 3 layers of muscle in her abdomen, & all 3 were cut, plus the external skin & the lining of the body cavity. //  All those layers need to heal completely, B4 she\\'s safe to be LOOSE WITH OTHER DOGS, off leash, or even to get close-enuf to another dog on leash that she might *consider* jumping on them! Some dogs are impatient but co-operative while they heal; others are going bonkers, & take every opportunity to jump on humans, will struggle to leap onto park benches as U walk past them, spend hours trying to get past the cone-collar & rip out the stitches, & so on.Hang in there, it\\'s only 10 days; lay in a good stock of durable chewables [sanitized marrow-bones, antler, cow hoof, bull pizzle...], & gather some training ideas to keep her busy. U might want to teach her to wear a T-shirt, preferably white or a pale cream color, so U can see the COLOR if there\\'s any drainage; secure it at her waist with a 4-inch wide ACE bandage & 3 or more diaper-size safety pins, clear thru all the layers of elastic, using Ur hand beneath the bandage to prevent her being stuck by the pin as U insert each one.The T-shirt also helps keep that bacteria-covered tongue off her incision, & the stitches safely away from her teeth.  If at any point her incision is WET, 1 or more stitches come out, the incision turns an angry red or dark-pink, or the incision swells around the stitches, go straight to the vet.A popped stitch will most-likely be glued with skin glue; any infection [swelling, draining, pus...] will probly need antibiotics. Aside from driving U nuts after the 1st 3 days, most dogs\\' spay incisions heal without any drama.   - terry .'}\n",

It\\'s good that the vet will see him this evening, & also that U sent the photos - documenting anything that doesn\\'t look right is a very, very good idea. Since the sutures popped the 1st time, it might be that Ur dog is allergic to / reacts to the suture material - skin glue might work better, or even surgical staples [which must be removed, after the incision heals]. Dogs or humans whose skin reacts badly to a particular suture material may need to have stitches that use a different kind of \"thread\". // Possibly even a butterfly clip would be able to secure this incision, but only the vet who did the surgery knows the extent of the wound, inside & out.All of these options are entirely up to the vet - no-one can tell, simply by looking at how long a cut is on the surface skin, what sort of closure it needs to heal properly, & even more importantly, there may be internal incisions that are deep, or possibly longer than the external cut.  Incisions to remove something can have 3 dimensions, L x W x H, & there may even be a void where the tissue was removed.We cannot tell what the inside of any incision looks like; only the surface is visible to our eyes. Do U know if his skin broke or tore, where the stitches were? - that could be a sign that his skin doesn\\'t get along with that suture material.Or did he get his teeth on it, & pull the stitches out, or chew them, & / or his own skin? Licking is definitely a bad thing, so keeping him from touching the area is important, to prevent infection.  U say he\\'s \"tied\" to confine him - is he at home, tethered, while U are at work?Or is he tethered nearby, where U can check on him?I would worry if he was tied at home, alone - it needs to be very short, so that he cannot possibly get the tether tangled or caught on anything, plus it needs to be a material he cannot chew thru.  A crate is much safer - altho i understand that not everyone has a crate, i can heartily recommend buying a used airline-approved shipping crate, so that if he needs to be confined again, U have a safe place to leave him, where he cannot get tangled, jump onto the sofa, get into the trash & eat garbage, & so on.CraigsList & FREEcycle are both good places to look - generally, buying a used crate saves about 1/2 the new price, & they last for decades, thru many dogs. I hope the vet can find something that will hold his skin securely, so the incision can heal properly. Do let us know what the vet says, please, & how Ur dog is doing?  I can understand entirely how worried U must be. take care, - terry .'}\n",

He had managed to remove all his stitches between the time we left the vet and the time we got home, maybe a 15 minute trip.  Back to the vet we went, where the wound was restitched.  A couple days later we were back at the vet because the wound was infected, and he had managed to pop a couple of stitches.  The vet took a look at my dog and told him he was getting on his nerves LOL, cleaned the incision and gave us some antibiotics.

A daily squirt of salt water (1 teaspoon salt in 500 ml boiled cool water) in a squeezy water bottle so you can direct squirt. 3 x day. For 3 days and review. Prevent licking with a elizabethan collar if required. Meanwhile. To me.. this 'rash' is not a rash as its too localised in 1 small area. Id suspect a minor wound dog is licking at more likely.

They were convinced at first he had liver failure.  More tests showed no his liver wasn't that bad but he had a severe infection from being on too much steroids for too long.  He died in the hospital the next day, just couldn't fight it off.  There's no way anyone could have diagnosed it without many clinical tests.

The BEST thing you can possibly do for her hips/joints is get the extra weight off of her.  My Chi x Dach, Zody, has luxating patella in both knees, and at one point he was fat.  His knees hurt him more so he did not want to do much but lay around and on walks he walked, no trotting for fat boy.  Now that he's lost the weight and is down to his ideal weight he loves to run and play, he trots on walks.  You can also start giving her fish oil, and a joint supplement.  The supplement I used Is this one https://www.amazon.com/Response-Cety...or%2Bdogs&th=1 2.  Start out slow and build up distance, if you notice her limping the next day take her on a very short walk of 1/2 to 1 block at most that day, and the next day when you take her on her regular walk (if she's no longer limping) do not let her do as much as on the day before.  I had an elderly severely arthritic dog who still wanted to run, and I quickly learned that I could only let him run for maybe a block at the most then I had to slow him down, letting him run any further would result in at least a day of limping.  We did still walk though, usually 4 or 5 blocks due to his age, he was also blind and got tired easily.  Swimming is great if she likest the water, none of mine have. 3.  You'll have to feed them on a schedule.  When I had Shadow and Jersey they were fed 2x a day and on a schedule.  They had around 20 minutes to finish their food, and they were fed apart from each other so no stealing went on.  Zody is the only one I have now and since he is fed so little, around 1/2 cup of food and 16 cal worth or treats) a day,  I divide the food up and feed him 3 to 4 meals per day.  doing that he never really feels hungry, and there's the added benefit that the hunger pukes have stopped.  How many meals you choose to feed your 2 is up to you, I'd recommend a minimum of 2 though, so that your boy has at least 2 chances to finish his food.\"}\n",

Based off the limited info given, my first thought after reading that he’s a 6 yr old 100 lbs Lab with acute lameness was an ACL injury. The age, breed, and obesity are all textbook predispositions for an ACL injury. Has anyone done X-rays on him or manually checked the position of his knee joint?'}\n",

I guess when you say biopsy you mean joint taps - as in samples of fluid taken from the affected joints?

Yes the puppa erupts into an adult based off environmental factors; which include heat, humidity, and vibrations. However the larvae stage instinctively goes towards the dark. Which means they bury themselves down in the carpet, baseboards, under furniture, and in the deepest cracks of your furniture. Unless your pets are frequenting all those places, there’s a fair chance that their vibrations might not wake a dormant pupae who has to wait for a change in temp or humidity for their signal to awake. The flea eggs don’t stick to your pet and fall off into the environment when they’re laid. The larvae doesn’t need to feed off your pet and has to spin a cocoon and be in that dormant stage transitioning into a pupae for at least 3 days. While you can use your pets as bait to “catch” and kill off the flea population, there is still the possibility for a pupae to remain dormant with a pet in the house just waiting for those other environmental factors so it can cause a new outbreak.'}\n",

How long have U had her? - Since puphood, or did she arrive as a teen or young-adult? Anxiety can be, as already mentioned, inherited / genetic - but that should have been apparent early on.I am presuming that for some unspecified while, her behavior was \\'normal\\' or at least in the normal range, as it seems that her behavior changed, correct? - & that\\'s when U became concerned. Anxiety can also be a symptom of a medical issue - hypothyroid can affect behavior, but *usually* hypothyroid manifests more as \"irritability\" than anxious - dogs act cranky, stuff that didn\\'t used to bother them now does, they have a lower threshold of tolerance than their usual self.A racing or erratic heartbeat [one symptom of Lyme disease] can defo provoke anxiety in dogs, just as it does in humans - in Lyme cases, the cardiac symptoms are often worst AT NIGHT, so the vet may not witness them. One complication of anxiety caused by environmental stimuli:Dogs can hear a far-greater range of frequencies than humans can, well into infrasonic & ultrasonic... so noises that upset a dog can be completely UN-heard by humans. // Don\\'t assume that if U can\\'t hear anything, the dog shouldn\\'t, either.  Some of the common audio-irritants for dogs: digital clocks, fluorescent light bulbs, compressors [used in refrigerators - Coke machines, the household \\'frig, refrigerated tractor-trailer rigs, etc], sodium-vapor lamps, ultrasonic humidifiers, distant thunder [infrasonic - dogs can hear an approaching storm while it\\'s still over 5-miles off, just how far depends on the intensity of the lightning generated], over-amped bass notes, the scream of sirens... Some dogs develop unfortunate associations that amount to superstitions:something BAD happens by sheer coincidence at the same time as something perfectly innocuous - the dog concludes that the \\'everyday\\' thing is connected to, possibly even the CAUSE of, the bad event.So the innocuous event becomes worrying, or even terrifying.One such pairing involved the thermostat switch for the heating / cooling system of a client\\'s house, but it took awhile to figure that out - we only knew that Spring & Fall, the dog was normal; winter & summer, he became increasingly anxious, pacing, drooling, whining subvocally, & seeking contact reassurance constantly.They shut off the HVAC to clean the vents, & suddenly from being a needy noodge, their anxious dog became chilled-out & calm; now we had WHAT, but not WHY.No matter - we just deliberately set out to pair the soft click of the switch with every wonderful event we could think of, from ice-cream to fetch games, & within 3 or 4 weeks, he didn\\'t even seem to notice it anymore.  I would certainly NOT predict or expect that a new dog nearby that Ur dog enjoys play with, would cause anxiety - that makes no sense. If anything, more social contacts create greater emotional resilience & better rebound from stress.So IMO - no; the new dog is not \"causing\" stress, but is very likely reducing it.   - terry .'}\n",

I made him \"cakes\" -made up sculptures of raw food. Watched red dog film. Let him herd one more time. I got 4 months more time before his sufferring began to kick in and he let me know it was getting to much. And then .... he died in my arms, with his favourite ball in his mouth as he was put to sleep and at peace. It has been the hardest loss. But soorhed by our bucket list time. Its been 6 months now. Time has helped. I have 10yrs of happy memories of sharing my life with him. Which no longer make me cry - i can smile at his memory. And only now and again- like now writing this, do i shed a tear. Its ok though, as my tears show me what a great bond we have, even after hes gone. Take care of you both. Get bucket list achieving.'}\n",

Our Dr referred one of our patients with severe lymphoma to the oncologist who ended up recommending the supplement as a last ditch effort.

My first dachshund (she died in 2016 at 18 y/o) had chronic sinusitis for over 8 years. Hers started after a swim in freezing (literally pieces of ice floating around her) bay water, and waxed and waned for a few years before finally becoming constant. A culture of her snot indicated that she had staph present in there, but it never resolved despite months of treatment with antibiotics it was supposedly sensitive to. It would change some with the seasons, but was persistent pretty much year round. I had dentistries done as my vet- who I worked for- thought her nasty teeth (she had a regular dentals, but rebuilt tartar pretty quickly) could be contributory, but that didn\\'t seem to make much difference. Examination of her mouth, throat, etc under sedation revealed no obvious issue, but there could have been something (polyp, tumor, ???) further in there that was contributing to her issues. It never seemed to bother her, and didn\\'t become severe until she was quite old (14+), by then I was reluctant to pursue advanced imaging and other more invasive diagnostics.  In hindsight, if I ever again have a dog with a persistent snot issue, I\\'d probably try to have my vet culture and treat accordingly first, and if that didn\\'t work, bite the bullet and see a specialist at that point, rather than waiting. That said, I had a kitten with a snotting problem from a few weeks old (I adopted her to a family member so I could keep tabs on her), and had a snot sample collected when she was spayed to have cultured- came up negative for bacteria, which was sort of bewildering and disappointing, as I was hoping for an answer and \"easy\" solution. Vet suggested it could be something anatomical, allergic response, or viral (FIV/FeLV neg), and recommended just monitoring and managing symptoms as my aunt was reluctant to pursue further since the kitten (now cat) was happy, eating, playful. Strangely, her issue resolved for several months after being spayed (Maybe related to ET tube/anesthesia? My vet couldn\\'t explain it), but eventually returned, though it is sporadic, and varies in intensity.  Are you in an area where foreign bodies (seeds, grass awns, etc) could be an issue? If so, might be worthwhile to investigate that route. I hope you find a cause, and it has an easy resolution'}\n",

I'm so glad to have found your post!  My German Shepard dog, Brady, has Hemophilia and was diagnosed when he was about 6-7 months old when he was neutered!  He is now almost 2 years old (will be 2 in February).  It has definitely been a long road so far with our extra special pup.  My husband and I also decided not to do any blood transfusions, due to the cost, and also that most of the vets we've seen said we can only do so many before other blood issues start to occur.    He has had quite a few episodes where he was down for a day or two, and about 2 serious episodes where he hurt himself playing or jumping and was bleeding into his joints. He developed large hematoma's on his back leg and was down for almost a month, one last year this time and just a few months ago.  We try to understand each injury when it comes and base the severity and his pain and go from there!   We tried Vitamin K supplements for a few months, didn't notice much change.  We have pain pills, anti-anxiety pills, pain lotions, anti-bleeding solutions that help to stop if we accidentally cut too far when trimming his nails, he broke a blood vessel by his eye on a tree branch and so we have multiple eye drops, ear drops, liquids for cuts to help keep clean until they stop bleeding.  It's a lot but we'd do anything for our pup!   Hope your Wally is on the way back up!\"}\n",

I don't want wally doing too much on his leg, so i am afraid of the pain pills and what he might do on them. I figured at night at least would be good for him. Just something to give him some relief.

We go through the winter slump every year, and ive never noticed it before.-We havent changed her food brand in a while. They like purina true instinct so i usually get that. I dont feed them human food. Unless we deer hunt then i usually cook the scraps and bones for them to eat, and i do think she licked less when she had a giant bone to chew on. I could perhaps try buying some bones, but id need an indestructible brand because she can chew through any bone in less than a day.  Any suggestions on brands that actually hold up well? -i liked this question, it made me think outside the box a bit. She did have access to the window, but the blinds are usually closed (we have weird neighbors). My other dog likes to stick his face through the blinds, but she never she has. Can dogs get seasonal affective disorder after no problems for years?? -i give them trifexis that the vet prescribed her and shes been on it for the past year and a half. In the summers i use tick collars but she hasnt had one for several months now.  If it is allergies, why is their such a sudden onset? I dont want to put the cone on her, and im constantly taking it off and putting it on when she has a bout of licking. Its exhausting! And its stressing me out worrying about her!! I know if i see the vet they will want to run blood tests and allergy tests and i cant afford to spend $300+ for them to tell me shes nervous or stressed or something simple like that. But again, i will if all else fails. She had a really rough life before we adopted her and my mother in law thinks shes suddenly acting out like this because of it.. Can i do anything else at home that might help if stress is the cause? Thank you all for playing pet health detective with me  And i truly am thankful for any and all advice. At this point, i would greatly appreciate inventions i can do at home over the next week to see if something helps without meds. If i have no luck with them we will visit the vet.'}\n",

There's a surprisingly good brand available at Walmart called ProSense that has good reviews and that you can get quickly, as well as this one available on both Amazon and ebay.

If the finances allow for it, at this point I would get a set of X-rays done, a comprehensive blood panel, and possibly a diarrhea panel. Personally I would start with the X-ray since it’s the least invasive, easy to interpret, and give you some peace of mind. Blood work would be the 2nd thing I would do, simply because I’ve seen a lot of red herrings with blood work results and most patients don’t have baseline blood values for us to compare what’s normal for that individual pet. The diarrhea panel would be my third choice due to the cost of testing. The diarrhea panel is often one of our last resort tests, because the majority of diarrhea issues can be diagnosed with the other routine tests, but at this point you’ve been dealing with 3+ months of chronic diarrhea so it’s certainly something to consider doing.'}\n",

These is often normal but it does rule out a few things.A bit of blood indicates the colon is more the problem and IBD is probably top of the list of potential causes.  A diet trial is often the way we diagnose, possibly along with some medication.  As already written this is not always as easy as it sounds.  Sometimes with collitis, even just adding some fibre to the diet can make a big difference as fibre is good for colon health.  Finally biopsies are the only way to be certain of a diagnosis but really need to be discussed with your vet as these are generally the last option when everything else has failed.\"}\n"

Since all you need for a woods lamp test is a black light, it's a very easy and cheap test to do, though you can get false negatives if it happens to be a fungus that isn't highly reactive to the black light.\"}\n",

Such people can opt for titers to test immunity instead.  I understand rabies is mandatory but for an animal with a history of a life threatening allergic reaction vaccinations every year or three can be an excessive risk if a titer shows adequate immunity for longer.My ancient horse has Cushing's and chronic Lyme both of which mess up the immune system and can cause sensitivities and extreme allergic reactions to many things.

Depending on state quarantine can be at the owners house or at a boarding facility. States have rabies protocol listed on the department of health website.

Coincidentally having seen rabid animals, it is the most depressing and painful death I have seen an animal suffer from. There was one horse who was so driven to bite that it would bit its own leg, then jerk its head with its leg still in its mouth, which resulted in it flipping itself over. It did this for about 5 hours before we could get permission to euthanize it. The horse broke its own leg about 3 hours into that 5 hour thing. I would not wish that death on anyone.\"}\n",

Quoting from the article linked above, Laryngeal Paralysis Is Not a Death Sentence  \"What happens in surgery, what is the prognosis, and are there any complications?The goal of surgery is to permanently open up the larynx to allow more air to get in. These days, most surgeons will do a “tie-back” procedure. Typically, surgery involves placing two heavy nylon sutures (i.e. permanent) to open up the left side of the larynx. Only one side is opened up to minimize the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In experienced hands, the outcome is typically good. Theoretically, surgery provides instant relief: with an open larynx, the patient can finally breathe. Then, of course, the pet needs to recover and heal after surgery. Clients routinely worry about doing this surgery in their older dog. My standard replies are: Age is not a disease.Lar Par is not a death sentence. It’s a bump along the road, which shouldn’t significantly affect the patient’s life expectancy as long as they don’t get aspiration pneumonia. Coughing is expected after surgery, typically after eating and mostly after drinking. That’s a good thing, as it will hopefully prevent the dog from \\'swallowing the wrong way\\'.  The voice will change, and barking disappears. However, failure of the sutures & a disease in the cartilage of the larynx is a rare but severe complication, which is why we insist on confinement, peace, and quiet after surgery.Another serious complication is aspiration pneumonia (also known as AP). This is a type of pneumonia due to aspiration, or inhalation, of food, water, saliva or vomit into the lungs. Thankfully it, like suture failure, is an uncommon complication.  What if my pet gets aspiration pneumonia? Then what?It\\'s crucial that aspiration pneumonia is caught early. We look for 4 criteria: coughing, lethargy, poor appetite and a fever. If you ever suspect AP, time is of the essence. A vet should see the patient ASAP, listen to the lungs and take chest X-rays to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment involves hospitalization, IV fluids, strong antibiotics, nebulization and a type of physical therapy called coupage.  What’s new with Laryngeal Paralysis?We now give patients an anti-vomiting drug (metoclopramide)  for life, after surgery. The hope is to decrease the risk of vomiting by helping move food downward.  It is cheap, with very few side effects, though one effect is hyperactivity.  Ironically, Labs are the number one breed affected by Lar Par, and many of them are rather hyper to begin with!  So far, we have not heard many complaints about using metoclopramide, though contra-indication is patients with seizures, so another anti-vomiting drug should be used. It is important to note that not all surgeons will prescribe this drug, so please don’t be surprised if it is not suggested. It is certainly not mandatory. These days, we don’t make the opening in the larynx as big as we used to, just enough for the patient to breathe comfortably. This is clearly art more than science, and you can see how experience comes into play. What’s the downside? The patient will likely have a noisier breathing, as air goes through a smaller opening. But again, as long as the patient can breathe comfortably, we don’t mind. As I now tell my clients, “I don’t treat noise, I treat dogs.”  What do I need to do at home after surgery?This will depends on your surgeon’s recommendations. In our practice, we recommend: - Strict rest for two months to allow healing with scar tissue - Soft food (\\'meat balls\\') for two weeks - Not too much water intake at once - Pain killers for seven days - Metoclopramide for life (again, not all surgeons do that) - Weight loss (these patients are often chubby), or weight control as needed - Long term, we recommend using a harness instead of a neck collar The only restriction is swimming: your dog will have a permanently open larynx, with no possibility of closing it off, should (s)he swallow water. There is therefore a risk of aspiration at best, and drowning at worst.   Overall, Lar Par is a stressful condition for the dog and a stressful situation for the guardian. Fortunately, in most cases, results of Laryngeal Paralysis surgery are good to excellent.   If you have any questions or concerns, you should always visit or call your veterinarian – they are your best resource to ensure the health and well-being of your pets.'}\n",

Because of the inability to swallow normally, IV administration is preferred.Animals with hemoconcentration should be administered IV fluids. If the animal is unable to eat without aspiration, extraoral or parenteral nutrition should be strongly considered.Extraoral alimentation with pharyngostomy, esophagostomy, or nasogastric tubes or temporary rumenostomy in ruminants can be an economical and effective way to provide nutritional support. Other treatments include local therapy for pharyngeal abscesses.  The prognosis for pharyngeal paralysis varies with the instigating cause. The prognosis for pharyngeal abscessation can be favorable, whereas the prognosis [in equine] for guttural pouch disease can be guarded.

Personally I'd take him in tomorrow and have them test him for parvo, and take him in next week and have them retest.  Hopefully he does not come down with it. Please keep in mind that the female pup can shed the virus for up to a month after she stops showing symptoms, so you're going to have to keep the pups separate for a good long while.  If I were you I'd set up a room for the female, scrub down the rest of the house with bleach, and quarantine the female pup.

It's heartbreaking to watch them slowly pass away. From the sound of it she's not going to get any better, so you have to ask yourself is she suffering.  There's nothing wrong with letting her sleep her day away, and wander around when shes' awake, so long as she's getting adequate nutrition and is not suffering.  If you think that she's suffering, if she's not eating, and you know that she's not going to get better, then it's time to let her go.  It's better to let them go a few days too soon, then to wait too long. Back when my elderly dog was still with me, I waited too long.  I should have let him go a week before he passed away, but I choose to try some medicine my vet prescribed to see if he's start eating again.  He didn't, so I called the vet and asked if it'd be alright to let him pass away naturally at home, or if he'd be in pain and I should I take him in and have him put to sleep.  I was told he shouldn't be in any pain, and it was alright to let him pass away naturally.  I had visions of him passing away peacefully in his sleep, it didn't happen that way.  I'll spare you the details though.  My greatest regret was not having him put to sleep the week before.   If you are just bringing your girl in to have her put to sleep then I'm sure that the vet can prescribe something.  Maybe ask if they can call it in to your local pharmacy.  If she loves the car, maybe give it to her, load her in the car and take her for one final drive.  You can stop and get her a hamburger or favorite food, and have that one last great memory.

If there's no vets in your area that will do this, call your vet and talk to him.  He should call in some sedating med to your closest pharmacy to make that trip less stressful or maybe he'll say it's ok to let her go peacefully at Hime.  I had a twenty tear old cat that I brought in once, the vet gave her a morphine patch that lasted five days and I took her home.  She died at home with me putting her on the fifth day before I had to get a new patch.When my last dog had weak hind legs and mobility issues from a spinal disease I got him a medical harness as he needed help walking and on stairs, but any sling worked, just put any long strip of material under her hips and help her walk or stand if she needs it.Your vet may be able to just prescribe a painkiller for her.

I did not know what an ectopic ureter was, and basically it is when the ureter (carries pee from kidneys to bladder) Ir incorrectly connected to the bladder (in my case) or connected to somewhere else, such as the vagina.

Just to let you know, this is an extremely rare condition, and often is asymptomatic in male dogs so it's likely not the issue you have, but I thought I would suggest it as something maybe you could mention to the vet  I would also suggest investing in some doggie diapers or belly bands so you can manage the issue until you get a diagnosis\"}\n",

Took many people to restrain him and he just learned to hate the vet and got aggressive at the vet.  Made the end of his life very stressful.  He was seventy pounds so not easy to restrain.  He would frantically paw non-stop until he could take most muzzles at least partially off.  Basically they'd only be on long enough to sedate gum.  Much kinder.  I only take my current dog to groomers so he doesn't learn to fear the vet the same way.  He's pretty good for vets so far but anxious and hates leaving me at all.  He doesn't like nail trims either but his nails are black and the quicks go all the way to the ends so I wouldn't risk cutting them myself and hurting him. Basket muzzles are the least restrictive and can be worn the longest but are still safe in preventing bites.  With positive reinforcement and treats you can get her used to wearing a muzzle. I tried avoiding cutting my last dog's nails and having him run on pavement to naturally wear them down. Didn't work, they broke and split and got sore and infected.  Once the paws and nails hurt the dog really doesn't want them touched.  So it's even worse.   Chains like Petco and PetSmart won't allow muzzles and won't allow owners in the grooming areas.  Private groomers might.  Your best bet is to find a good groomer that you like that works well with her that she learns to trust and won't bite.    I tried the boots with my last dog, he pulled them off every time and finally chewed them up so they were unusable.i never see anyone in the city using them, just blankets for short haired or small dogs.I personally won't have the vet do nails again after my last dog learned to hate the vet because of too many bad nail trim experiences.  It got to the point where they couldn't even listen to his heart without him lunging and snapping.\"}\n",

It\\'s fungicidal, anti-microbial, non-toxic, helps to toughen pads, & is very very safe - the process is straightforward, use bagged black-tea or loose black tea; the bags are typically cheaper & as they\\'re already contained, it\\'s simpler, but if U like to use loose tea, just adapt the process. Pour cold water over the tea-bag as it sits in a bowl, enuf to cover plus an extra 1/4-inch or so above the bag; let it stand overnight in the \\'frig, it should swell considerably, & suck-up practically all the H2O.Put on a pair of disposable gloves, & squeeze every drop of concentrated tea out of the bag that U can, into the same bowl; use a 2x2 square of sterile gauze, & pat don\\'t \"wipe\" the affected area. Discard the used gauze B4 U move to the next pad / paw, so that U don\\'t carry along any microbes. If U let the dog LICK it, it won\\'t work - take her for a walk, play tug, somethin\\', till it dries; just keep her busy, & let it dry out. IF SHE WON\\'T LET IT BE -bootee her foot with a waterproof boot for outside trips [disposable boots are good].put a tube-sock on it for indoors secured at the top with vet-wrap [which sticks to itself & leaves no residue on hair, feathers, or skin]. If she tries to remove the vet-wrap & sock, use MITTEN CLAMPS or MATTRESS CLIPS or GARTER-BELT BUTTONS to secure the sock on the outside of each leg, & run elastic over her shoulders between the clamps / clips / buttons, to keep the socks up, under the vet-wrap; put a Cone on her, to keep her from messing with it; the deeper, the better.The vet-wrap goes over sock-top AND clamp / clip / button, to hide them.  For drying purposes:Check with yer vet to be assured this is OK -Organic cornstarch is hydrophilic [repels moisture] & non-toxic - dust it over the surface thinly, then dry clean socks with vet-wrap & / or elastic \"suspenders\" with the clamps / clips / garter buttons.

The vinegar acidifies the pH of the ear canal & knocks down yeast, which prefers alkaline conditions.The H2O2 is a drying agent that reduces moisture; be aware that U cannot make the stuff ahead, nor can it be kept, as the H2O2 boils off & becomes water [losing the extra Oxygen]. For instance, 2 tsp H2O2, 1 tsp distilled H2O, 1 tsp organic [live] apple-cider vinegar, should treat both ears & waste little.Or make up 1 tsp H2O2, 1/2 tsp each of distilled h2o & apple-cider vinegar. Use an eye-dropper, & let the mixture dribble down the side of the ear-canal - DON'T insert the dropper in the opening.It may take 2 ppl to do this, one to hold the dog's head with the ear being treated upward & head tilted, one to carefully dribble the mix into the ear opening. // Squish it around by mashing the ear pinna to the dog's head with yer thumb, gently but firmly; hold the dog's head against Ur torso with one hand, mash yer thumb into the dog's ear, & rub gently. Itchy dogs will generally lean into this HARD, & groan as U rub - mashing it around distributes the fluid; if U let go of their head too soon, the dog will just shake it out vigorously, & no good will be done.Pressing a 2x2 gauze square under the ear pinna will dry-up some of the excess; then let the dog shake, & standing her or him in the tub-shower is a good precaution, so they can shake all the goop out of the ear, & U can flush it off the wall & shower-curtain, down the drain.  Give the dog a high-protein treat [something they tolerate well or thrive on] B4 doing the other ear.Repeat the process, immobilize head, dribble into tilted-up ear, mash pinna & squish about to distribute, press with fresh gauze, let dog SHAKE, give a high-value treat; let the dog go with the bathroom door closed, so they shake while still confined, vs running from the room to rub ear-goo onto the white brocade sofa, the blonde shantung drapes, ________ .  U know they will!  This can be repeated weekly, or for dogs who swim often & are prone to swimmer's ear, after every swim [50/50 so long as the skin is intact / no lesions, no scabs, no weeping]. This is GRAS / Generally Regarded As Safe, but still phone the vet to get their opinion, just in case.   - terry .\"}\n"

I'd suggest you find a food that is chicken free and see if your boy becomes less itchy.  He could have a combination of environmental, and food allergies, in which case the itching won't go completely away, but I'd start by getting him off the chicken, make sure to also toss any treats that you have that contain chicken, or feeding him a chicken free food isn't going to do much good.   This food is a bit more expensive, but it's a decent brand and it's grain free, and chicken free.. https://www.chewy.com/taste-wild-pac...-free/dp/34250 You can also try organic, virgin, cold pressed, coconut oil.

Neutering is generally a pretty simple procedure. I'd be upset as well if they cut my dogs' nails after being told not to, especially if they injured the poor dog in the process. I guess you're lucky they didn't remove the dew claws.  You say you have two vets in the area: how bad is the other one? We had a family vet that we generally liked pretty well, even though her practice had some shortcomings. When I got Chisum, though, I had to cut ties - it turned out that she just wasn't experienced/willing/accepting of dogs with anxiety issues and wasn't going to budge at all to provide support (he didn't do anything wrong - she wouldn't even start the process of getting bloodwork done).

Certainly no play with other dogs, no free running, no swimming, and limit jumping as much as possible.  I would personally not be taking him on much leashed walks either- an abdominal incision is a serious thing that needs rest to heal.   Is this the first dog you've had altered?  2 weeks limited activity/leashed walks only is pretty typical for both spay and neuter.  Certainly it's more common in spays, but given his incision is abdominal I'd be treating it more like a spay anyways. I had to do a 2 week limited activity period with my high energy field bred lab pup when he hurt his shoulder.  He went from his crate to his X-pen, had maybe 2 or 3 short leashed walks a day, went out for potty breaks, and that was it.  He got all his food from puzzle toys or training, and got at least 2 enrichment treats a day (usually 1 pupsickle and a frozen kong).  Shaping can help get mental energy out.  Luckily this dog had been trained with both crate and x-pen as a pup, so that helped, but I do agree containment is important for at least the first week after surgery, especially when there are other dogs in the house they usually play with.\"}\n",

Cigarette butts, napkins, paper towels, acorns, sticks, rocks, cat food, poop, horse hoof clippings, grass, my car, doors, floors, boxes, leashes, a wicker basket,  squeakers out of toys once he shreds the toy, his food bowl once it's empty if I don't refill it fast, socks, random food he finds, you name it.After I read every hit Google has and all the conflicting information, I usually give in and call the local 24/7 vet hospital and ask them if it's an emergency, can wait, even needs to be seen and what to watch for.  I've been a frequent flyer there with many older sick pets the past few years. The one thing my past and present dogs haven't chewed up or eaten is shoes or anything leather that I can remember, mainly because my leather horse things and other belongings are expensive and I think they picked up subconsciously that if they wanted to keep their spoiled loving home with me, they'd not mess with the leather stuff.So that's the one thing I don't know about.  Although I'd guess from the number of puppies who have chewed up shoes over years, it's probably not an immediate emergency since it was a small piece.  But I'm not a vet.Welcome to dog ownership!  If you have a dog that chews, soft toys don't last long.  My dog can demolish a soft toy and swallow the squeaker from it in less than five minutes.  He can also chew through his leash in under two minutes in the backseat while I'm driving.  Smart dogs can be a bit tricky lol.\"}\n",

Additionally, laser surgery seals blood vessels as they're cut, & thus limits blood loss - which the OP's vet also said was a serious concern. For all i know, opting for amputation instead of dissection might make the surgery possible - or amputation plus laser might make the difference. OTOH, none of us knows the prognosis of this dog - for all we know, he may have only weeks of survival time, which would make tissue-sparing dissection of the tumor or even amputation, pretty pointless.If we cannot improve the quality of his life by sparing him pain, or extend his life in a meaningful fashion so that he can still enjoy some quality of life, then any major intervention could actually be abuse.Without that critical info, we can't say. What we have is the information the owner has provided. I am not a vet. I am quite literally listing the very Qs that i would ask MY vet, if my dog could avoid further suffering & *possibly* extend their life, by having fewer drugs [to spare their damaged kidneys] plus laser surgery. I would further ask my vet just how long amputation would take, using a laser to minimize blood-loss, & what the prognosis of my dog is, in days, weeks, or months.If 5-minutes or less under a local anaesthetic with a laser would potentially extend my dog's life AND relieve their pain, & assuming that my dog could also take post-surgery pain meds AND blue-laser healing treatments to minimize inflammation & cut healing time, why would i not do that? There is also ketamine -  whether this would stress the dog's kidneys or liver too much, i don't know.If this were my dog, that's another Q that i'd ask. If ketamine spared the organs & made the dog safe to operate on, & a rapid amputation with laser would then be possible, with a reasonable prognosis of fair quality of life on 3 legs --- for a while - Why not do it?  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4258981/ QUOTE, Recent clinical applications ...Procedural sedation for adults and children: The literature is strongly supportive of the safety and efficacy of ketamine for emergency department (ED) dissociative sedation, for a variety of brief painful or emotionally disturbing procedures in both children and adults, e-g.: Laceration repair, fracture reduction, abscess drainage, emergency cardio-version, amputation, chest tube insertion.It is useful for procedures in the mentally disabled, who are often unco-operative. [43] This dissociative sedation can be readily achieved by administration of a single IV or IM loading dose of ketamine followed by titration.[43]Intranasal ketamine is being used in a wide range of clinical doses for procedural sedation in children (0.5 - 9 mg/ kg). [44, 45] It is used for sedation or general anesthesia for pediatric procedures like cardiac catheterization, radiation therapy, radiological studies such as MRI, dressing changes, & dental work.[1, 3, 46]Ketamine in low doses in combination with low-doses propofol provides effective & safe sedo-analgesia in pediatric emergency short surgical procedures & in adults undergoing colonoscopy & short gynecological procedures [47,48,49]___________________________________________  All of these, of course, assume that i can afford them:laser-surgery, the amputation co$t, the vet's fee, post-surgery blue-laser Tx, possibly a transfusion from the vet's stock or a self-transfusion from my dog, plus follow-up care, post-surgery meds [antibiotics, pain Rx or OTC], etc.   Surgery without general-anaesthesia or even a local was done for centuries & continues to be done, but those surgeries are on humans, & so not topical.   Personally, I've twice had procedures, surgery / stitches, sans anaesthesia -the 1st was a root-canal on an abscessed tooth, gone so far, i could time my pulse by it. I was in agony. WARNING: painful description:my dentist, whom i trusted & had known for years, told me the swelling was so bad, he could not ascertain the bottom, so i had to be able to feel it & TELL him when the drill got there.It hurt like H***, but i did not move, i gave him the high-sign when the drill bottomed out, & the relief when the pressure eased was enormous. // I was 21 at the time, & that was over half my lifetime ago.Do i think i should have died, rather than have a painful but relatively-short surgical procedure to remove an infection that could have become life-threatening?... Of course not. The second was after an accident in the kitchen -I was the chef in a PSU fraternity, & breaking down a pork-loin into chops. The knife hit a curved inside-joint surface & skidded, cutting so deeply into the left index finger's proximal knuckle, that both joint & ligaments were visible. // I was prepping for Homecoming weekend, & i couldn't bend my hand, because the wound would instantly bleed in a heavy seep.Off to the E.R. -- One of the brothers drove me there.On arrival, they had no locals that did NOT contain pseudo-epinephrine, which i can't tolerate.   The Dr on duty gave me 10 stitches, 3 internal & 7 external, when i should have had 12 - he was so upset over sticking me sans numbing agents that he fiddled & faffed over every stitch, taking twice as long or more, & he SKIPPED 2, at the center of the wound, where the stress was greatest when i flexed my hand. (I kept telling him to get on with it, please, i'm okay - that it would hurt less if he just did it & got it over with, but he couldn't seem to steel himself.)As a result of his tender sensibilities, the scar is wider than it should have been, & i had to wear a home-made aluminum splint for 10-days to keep the stitches from cutting thru my skin if i inadvertently flexed that knuckle - I had only 9 usable fingers, & one rigid useless stick with a metal splint & lots of vet-wrap, securing it.Do i think i should NOT have gotten stitches? - Of course not.Do i think that i should have stayed at home, & quit my job, to nurse my own hand full-time, vs get fully-sentient stitches & deal with the pain when using my hand? - of course not.I needed to be employed; i needed my wages. Leaving it open to continue bleeding, or to get infected, would be asinine; joint infections are bu**ers to knock down, & readily spread to become body-wide sepsis.So in both instances, painful treatment w/o anaesthesia certainly beat no Tx at all.   EuthanasiaWe don't euthanize humans who are suffering; in some cases, IMO & IME as a caregiver, we merely prolong their pain. Euthanasia, when the person is compos mentis, is terminal or suffers untreatable pain, & that person desires it, could be an incredible kindness - again, IMO.The closest we approach it is assisted suicide, & that's legal only in a few nations / states. // Our pets can be legally killed with minimal pain, to spare them & ourselves further suffering; because they cannot kill themselves, we extend this last gift to them. whether the OP's dog is in serious pain now, we don't know; whether their dog's pain will ramp-up quickly & wreck any remaining quality of life, we don't know.Whether the dog might live in relative comfort for a few more months, once free of that tumor, we don't know - only a vet who's seen the dog, & the owner who's heard that vet's diagnostic opinion, knows if there is a chance for a bit more time, or if it is best to resign oneself, & stop all suffering by euthanizing the dog. Everyone dies; how one dies, or when, may or may not be a decision we get to make. But we can make choices for our pets - which choices we make are entirely personal.I had a client who opted to euthanize her lean, whipcord-tough 18-MO 45# dog, rather than amputate his foreleg - the one with bone-cancer eating the wrist.  I thought it was not a good choice - he was young, otherwise healthy, a narrow-framed dog who could easily & happily live as a tripod.But he was HER dog - not mine.  @london1234 - is there any update? -- How's he doing, & how are U coping? all my best, - terry .\"}\n",

You can buy it on Amazon.com. Use it several times a week, and back off slowly until you can maybe get her down to once or twice monthly baths. (Taper the baths once her scratching and oiliness is under control). Allergies get worse as a dog ages. There are new medications you can get from your vet that work very well for most dogs. One is a pill called Apoquel and the other is a shot called Cytopoint (or CADI). The pill is given daily, but the shot lasts from 4-8 weeks. Both are made by the same manufacturer, Zoetis. They both stop the itch factor from reaching the pup's brain. You should only need to use one or the other, although there are a few dogs that need both to keep their allergies under control. These meds seem to be safer than long term usage of Cortisone shots or oral Prednisone. Also, a prescription food may help immensely if it is food related allergies. All three of my pups are fed Royal Canin Hydrolyzed Protein prescription food for small breeds. You can buy it at Chewy.com with a script from your vet. I have a 14 year old Chihuahua, Tucker, a 9 year old Maltese, Jack, and a 6 year old Sheltie mix, Ollie. They are all rescue pups and they all have allergy issues. Tucker does well on Benadryl, but Jack and Ollie are on Apoquel. Allergy issues can be frustrating and difficult to deal with and try to figure out, but in the end you have a happier healthier pup which will in turn make your and her life less stressful.\"}\n",

I can just tell you personally what I'd do and what I've done in the past.  I'd fast him for a minimum of 12, preferably 24 hours, offer water during the fast and if he throws that up then it's time to get him to the vet in the morning because he could become dehydrated.  If he keeps the water down then continue to fast him for the 12 to 24 hours, at the end of it offer him a tablespoon of the chicken and rice, wait an hour then offer him a tablespoon more, keep doing that for a few hours then up the amount to 1/4 of a cup again waiting an hour to make sure he keeps it down.  If at any point he starts throwing it up it's time to get him to the vet.  If he's keeping the food down work your way up to a full portion 2 to 3 times a day, and keep him on it for at least 2 full days before trying to wean him back on his regular food. The reason for the fast is so that his stomach has a chance to settle down and heal from whatever is causing the nausea and vomiting.  Again if the vomiting continues, or his symptoms get worse then get him to the vet.  Some vets are open on Saturday and you might want to get him checked out rather then wait and have to pay the emergency fee if you have to take him in on a Sunday.  A few months ago back when my dog have very similar symptoms to your on a Friday night, after calling to see if I couldn't get him seen on an emergency basis that night (he was throwing up water), and finding out that no vet was available, none even bothered calling back -,- , I took him to the vet that was opened on Saturday morning, luckily since they were open and it was normal office hours I skipped the emergency vet fee.

What are his biscuits made of? - Most biscuits are grain-based carbs with flavoring.[Most dogs are neither allergic nor intolerant of grains - they might have problems with one, but not \"all grains\".A small subset of dogs is gluten-intolerant, but it\\'s a far-smaller fraction than in humans; IBD / IBS is a different issue.The most common allergies in dogs are to proteins, not carbs - beef, chicken, lamb, etc.]  What color is his skin, under his hair? - most dogs are very fair-skinned, & have near-white skin.[Pigment colors the skin under spots & pied patches - but Ur dog doesn\\'t appear to be spotted or pied.] If his skin is GREY in color, & feels slightly thickened, when U pick the skin up & roll it gently, plus his skin is GREASY as well as flaking, those are all symptoms of hypothyroid. I would ask my vet to take a blood sample, then send it to either Michigan State Univ vet-labs, or HemoPet Labs.MSU\\'s vet college has the world\\'s largest breed-specific database of thyroid values, & they\\'re excellent at analysis; Dodd\\'s HemoPet labs enjoy a worldwide reputation. Both of them receive specimens from around the world, every day. A full thyroid panel is at least 5 & possibly 6 measurements: free & bound forms of both T3 & T4, plus TSH / Thyroid Stimulating Hormone, & possibly an ANA / Anti Nuclear Antibody test, in addition.The ANA test can tell U if the dog has an auto-immune issue & is attacking their own tissues. Do NOT let the vet persuade U to \"save money\" by skipping one or more tests; U only want to do this once, so I\\'d squeeze every drop of knowledge out of that specimen!The distance between free & bound forms is like measuring between floor & ceiling - U need both, to get useful data. Also, some vets will offer to do the analysis in house, or say U can save money by sending it to the local hospital - i\\'d resist. A sheet of numbers means little without the follow-up analysis, & a local GP vet is unlikely to have the specialist knowledge of MSU\\'s endocrinologists, or HemoPet\\'s vet staff, with 25 or 30 years focussed on blood-borne diseases in dogs. If U really truly cannot cover the cost of sending the sample away for analysis, GET A 2nd OPINION from either MSU or HempPet - send them the numbers, & tell them the dog\\'s breed/s, age, etc, list the skin issues, even include the photo - their advice is IMO solid gold, it\\'s worth spending the extra to get truly accurate, in-depth analysis. If his results are \"borderline low\", I\\'d be prepared to talk to my vet about a short course of low-dose thyroid supplement - 3 to 4 weeks should show the effects, if any; if his skin improves, the flaking is less, hair is coming in where the follicles aren\\'t damaged, the skin texture is more normal, & HE SHOULD lose wt, while eating the exact same # of calories / day...then that\\'s reason enuf to continue the thyroid supplement. Dogs who need it, need it all their lives - but once they get the dose properly calibrated, the Rx is very cheap. It saves lives, improves health, & is very, very worthwhile, IME.  - terry .'}\n",

It might be worth your while to consult with a dental specialist if you want to avoid removal of the teeth- sometimes they can be salvaged. I don't blame you if you are choosing extraction over those options if you have already considered them, as they can be expensive and sometimes still result in extraction. You might be describing the 4th premolar, which is the biggest tooth on the side of the upper jaw. It has 3 roots, so often is split into 3 pieces for ease of removal unless already quite loose. Sometimes the vet will sew a little flap of gingival tissue (gum) over the resulting defect to keep stuff from getting in it. I've had several dogs with slab fractures of this tooth (my current dog has a small chip missing from one of his from chewing a bone), and I think one had it extracted as a result when it appeared to cause discomfort, and did fine. My understanding is that the canine teeth tend to be more complicated and difficult extractions in most cases due to the massive length of the root, so I guess there could be worse teeth for her to have damaged. Most dogs that I've seen post tooth extractions tend to be no worse for the wear, and have minimal problem eating, playing, etc after a brief recovery period. Good luck!\"}\n",
