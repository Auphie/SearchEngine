       "     'content': \"  Hi There, \\r\\nMyself and my family are looking for a puppy. I live with my partner and 2 children who are 2 and 7. My 7 year old has High Functioning autism and he has an amazing 'connection' with dogs. I have looked it having a dog that could maybe help him with things. Nothing too serious, but he doesn't socialize well and after years of observing, I can see a dog would be a brilliant addition, not only for the whole family but for him too. \\r\\nWe have looked into breeds and decided the best choices were a Lab or a Cocker Spaniel. We have gone towards a Cocker Spaniel because we live in a 3 bed house (Large garden and backs onto fields and a long bike path walk that goes for 13 miles with no cars!) and thought it would be the best size wise.  \\r\\nThis evening we went to see some puppies, and unfortunately I think it was from a puppy farm. (I don't want to write what happened here...) \\r\\nSince coming home, I have researched more and have seen that the show cockers, can have 'rage syndrome' and I was wondering what this is, and how common it is? Would it be dangerous to have this breed around my children?  \\r\\nAlso, are there other breeds that would be good for us as a family? My partner always had dogs and is very passionate about bringing up dogs, but he grew up in the countryside with labs and collies so its a little bit different. \\r\\nWe did look at a rescue dog. Most were staffys and I'm too wary of those, especially from a rescue centre. The one we walked was an odd mix, of Lakeland Terrier and Huskamute! She was lovely, but they didn't know the background and I didn't want to take her and her to end up not having the temperement we were looking for. \\r\\nAnyway, I've blabbed on here, sorry. I just don't want to be someone who goes out on a whim, with no research or ideas and just gets any dog that looks cute! Could have easily taken the dog this evening (all of them!) but I do have to be sensible. \\r\\nThanks in advance  \",\n",

       "     'content': \"  Hi There, \\r\\nMyself and my family are looking for a puppy. I live with my partner and 2 children who are 2 and 7. My 7 year old has High Functioning autism and he has an amazing 'connection' with dogs. I have looked it having a dog that could maybe help him with things. Nothing too serious, but he doesn't socialize well and after years of observing, I can see a dog would be a brilliant addition, not only for the whole family but for him too. \\r\\nWe have looked into breeds and decided the best choices were a Lab or a Cocker Spaniel. We have gone towards a Cocker Spaniel because we live in a 3 bed house (Large garden and backs onto fields and a long bike path walk that goes for 13 miles with no cars!) and thought it would be the best size wise.  \\r\\nThis evening we went to see some puppies, and unfortunately I think it was from a puppy farm. (I don't want to write what happened here...) \\r\\nSince coming home, I have researched more and have seen that the show cockers, can have 'rage syndrome' and I was wondering what this is, and how common it is? Would it be dangerous to have this breed around my children?  \\r\\nAlso, are there other breeds that would be good for us as a family? My partner always had dogs and is very passionate about bringing up dogs, but he grew up in the countryside with labs and collies so its a little bit different. \\r\\nWe did look at a rescue dog. Most were staffys and I'm too wary of those, especially from a rescue centre. The one we walked was an odd mix, of Lakeland Terrier and Huskamute! She was lovely, but they didn't know the background and I didn't want to take her and her to end up not having the temperement we were looking for. \\r\\nAnyway, I've blabbed on here, sorry. I just don't want to be someone who goes out on a whim, with no research or ideas and just gets any dog that looks cute! Could have easily taken the dog this evening (all of them!) but I do have to be sensible. \\r\\nThanks in advance  \",\n",
